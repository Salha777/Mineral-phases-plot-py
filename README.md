This repo contains python scripts for scatter plots of mineralisation data 
The data we're plotting is available in .csv and excel formats and is split into 4 columns 
Assuming the columns and formatting are conserved, these datasheets can be adapted to store and plot the results of any mineralisation experiments. 
Here we choose to use Magnesium sources with the aim of making different magnesium carbonate phases.
